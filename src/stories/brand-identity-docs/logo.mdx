# Logo

Our company logo consists of the word "PROVENANT" (IBM Plex Sans Semi-Bold), with the trustmark preceding it. The space between the trustmark and the initial "P" is the same width as the "P". Letters are all CAPS, and default settings are used for kerning:

## Sizing

The standard size of this logo is 200x40 pixels and uses a 20-point font. 
A half-sized version is also recommended where appropriate. 
Although the logo is available as a vector graphic and could thus be arbitrarily sized, 
other sizes are discouraged since they weaken our brand consistency and push the precision 
of font scaling and kerning engines. The aspect ratio and the padding around the text must 
be preserved as modeled in the SVG files.

## Using the Tag Line

Our tag line may be displayed beneath the logo, centered and in a font that produces the same 
width as the main word.

<p align="center">
    <img src={logoUsingTagLine} alt="Using Tag Line" width="150"/>
</p>

This tagged form of the logo may not be scaled smaller than 100x30, as the tagline becomes illegible.

## As Pure text

< Provenant may be used as a pure-text version of our logo in text files.

## In Different Color Themes

The logo is designed to render well on either light or dark backgrounds. 
Monochrome versions of the logo are also available (see the brand folder for details).

## Product Names and Logos

The logos for our products use the same color and trustmark, but are not in all-caps.

    <img src={logoOrigin} alt="Logo Origin" width="100"/>

Like the company logo, this logo has various standard sizes, as well as monochrome versions. 
See the brand folder for details.
