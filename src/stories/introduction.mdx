# About This Document And Related Artifacts

This document is a quick reference for choices made during Provenant's August 2022 branding update. 
We did nowhere near the kind of work that's involved in a serious brand initiative, so the output is incomplete. We expect to improve it later.

Most brand assets (including this doc) live in a [folder in Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SEwMCZoKluBTydei8pL0o4BKLpGBKHjM?usp=sharing). 
Our [mobile colors](https://www.figma.com/file/fim4Pm6ag2hn7RJrfq5EzI/Provenant-mobile-colors?node-id=0%3A1) and icons are saved as Figma components.

## Name and Identifier

## Voice and Tone
In all our writing, we use clear, concise language with US English spellings and punctuation conventions. We use short sentences. We consistently use correct terms.

When communicating with the general public, we do our best to minimize jargon. We assume that our audience consists of adults with some post-high-school education, and with enough tech savvy to install an app and to worry about phishing and other forms of inauthentic communication on the internet. However, we do not assume we are talking to computer scientists or PhD cryptographers. 

When we address users, we use a casual, matter-of-fact, friendly conversational tone, and we use the pronoun "I" to refer to the software and "you" to refer to the user. We use complete sentences rather than fragments, and we avoid the common techie habit of omitting pronouns to make sentences shorter:

<ul>
    <li>
        **Good:** "I couldn't get the server to respond. This sometimes happens when the internet is flaky. Do you want to use a different URL, or try again later?"
    </li>
    <li>
        **Bad:** "Server didn't respond. Internet may be flaky. Try later?"
    </li>
</ul>
